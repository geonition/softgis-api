The softGIS api provides django apps to set up a REST API
for saving and retrieval of geographical information.

To install all the applications you need to install geodjango and:

1. Add the softgis application name to INSTALLED_APPS

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'softgis_feature'
    'softgis_user'
    ....
)

2. Set a url in the urls for the installed application e.g.

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^client/', include('api.softgis_client.urls')),
    (r'^user/', include('api.softgis_user.urls')),
    (r'^profile/', include('api.softgis_profile.urls')),
    (r'^feature/', include('api.softgis_feature.urls')),
    ....
)
